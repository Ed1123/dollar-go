# Dollar Prices, but in Go
Website to display dollar prices from my own [API](https://github.com/Ed1123/dollar-price-api/tree/main/dollar_price).

## Running
If you have [air](https://github.com/air-verse/air) installed you could just run `air`. Otherwise:
```bash
go run cmd/main.go
```
App will be available at `localhost:8080`.
